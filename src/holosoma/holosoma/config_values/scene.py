"""Named scene presets, selectable via the ``scene:`` subcommand.

Each preset hard-defines which assets are spawned; can override fields of a preset's assets
at the CLI (e.g. ``scene:object-managers-demo --scene.rigid-objects.free-box.position 0.9 0 0.7``),
but cannot add/remove assets (the preset fixes the set of keys).

This module holds ONLY production scenes — the ones a shipped experiment, the run-sim CLI, or the
object-managers example actually use. The much larger set of scenes that exist only to drive the
cross-backend test harnesses lives in ``tests/simulators/_scene_presets.py`` and is registered into
:data:`DEFAULTS` at test time (so the production ``scene:`` menu stays small and core never imports
from ``tests/``). ``DEFAULTS`` is a plain dict on purpose: tests append to it via that module's
``register()``.

# same preset runs under all four backends. Names are the ObjectRegistry keys the managers
# address: free bodies = {free_box, moving_box, scene_free_box}, static = {pillar, scene_static_post}.
